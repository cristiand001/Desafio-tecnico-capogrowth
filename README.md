# Technical Challenge – CapoGrowth

This repository contains a technical challenge project focused on building a Mercado Libre publication analyzer using modern full-stack practices.

## Objective

Develop an application that:

- Connects to Mercado Libre using OAuth (server-side only)
- Fetches data from an existing Mercado Libre publication
- Persists item data and description in Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Uses OpenAI to analyze the publication and generate actionable recommendations

The goal is not only the final result, but also to demonstrate:

- Clean architecture decisions
- Proper server/client boundaries
- Secure handling of secrets
- Clear documentation and reasoning

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**
- **Mercado Libre API**
- **OpenAI API**

## Architecture

The proposed architecture and technical decisions are documented in:
